# Using React Components

Steps to the react component within your React project

### Add @openmrs/react-components as a dependency

npm install @openmrs/react-components

### Add babel-polyfill as a dependency and import it

Saga requires that babel-polyfill be installed and configured for your project:

npm install babel-polyfill

Then make you you import 'babel-polyfill' in your entry file (ie index.js)

### Add react-redux, redux-saga and redux-form as dependencies

npm install react-redux
npm install redux-saga
npm install redux-form

Also recommended, redux-logger:

npm install redux-logger

### Create or update a redux-store that injects the reducers and sagas provided by @openmrs/react-components

They should be injected under the "openmrs" namespace.

See example store at samples/redux-store.js

For an example of how to inject a Redux store, see samples/App.jsx

For a documentation of how to use the components check out the [readme](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-react-components/tree/OEUI_183/src/components#patientheader) for components

## Bootstrap

UI components within the library generally use Bootstrap styles.  *However* the bootstrap css files are not included
in the released bundle.  Library consumers must provide the Bootstrap styles (or their own alternatives) within there
own app.

For information on including the stylesheet, see:

https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction

Note that you may also need to include react-bootstrap and react-dom as dependencies in the app that uses react components
(TODO: confirm this?)

If you are using the create-react-app template, you can install and use the Bootstrap CSS by following the steps here:
